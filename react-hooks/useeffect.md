# useEffect

Sometimes, however, we need our components to reach outside this data-flow process and directly interact with other APIs. An action that impinges on the outside world in some way is called a _side effect_. Common side effects include the following:

* dealing with manual DOM changes.
* Logging messages to the console or other service
* Setting or getting values in local storage
* Fetching data or subscribing and unsubscribing to services
