The signature for the `useState` Hook is as follows:

```jsx
                 const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
//                        ðŸ‘†      ðŸ‘† 
// Think about it as a getter and a setter
```

Here, `state` and `setState` refer to the state value and updater function returned on invoking `useState` with some `initialState`.

Itâ€™s important to note that when your component first renders and invokes `useState`, the `initialState` is the returned state from `useState`.

**Always remember that the value of the state is always the initial state value on the first render**
