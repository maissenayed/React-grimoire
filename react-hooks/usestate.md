The signature for the `useState` Hook is as follows:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/useState2 (1)>)

Here, `state` and `setState` refer to the state value and updater function returned on invoking `useState` with some `initialState`.

Itâ€™s important to note that when your component first renders and invokes `useState`, the `initialState` is the returned state from `useState`.

## Declare State Variable <a href="#declare-state-variable" id="declare-state-variable"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Always remember that the value of the state is always the initial state value on the first render**
{% endhint %}

```jsx
 const [state] = useState(100)
 return <div> State variable is {state}</div>
```

## Update State Variable <a href="#update-state-variable" id="update-state-variable"></a>

Also, to update state, the state updater function `setState` should be invoked with a new state value, as shown below:

```jsx
setState(newValue)
```

By doing this, a new re-render of the component is queued. `useState` guarantees that the `state` value will always be the most recent after applying updates.

For referential checks, the `setState` functionâ€™s reference never changes during re-renders.

Here an example of a Counter component that use `useState` to update the counter by one for each click

```jsx
const Counter = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)
  const handleClick = () => setCounter(counter + 1)

  return (
    <div>
      Counter:{counter}
      <div>
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Get older! </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Functional updates <a href="#functionalupdates" id="functionalupdates"></a>

The state updater function returned by `useState` can be invoked in two ways. The first is by passing a new value directly as an argument:

```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialStateValue)

// update state as follows
setState(newStateValue)
```

This is correct and works perfectly in most cases. However, there are cases where a different form of state update is preferred: _**functional updates**_.

Hereâ€™s the example above revised to use the functional update form:

```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialStateValue)

// update state as follows
setState((previousStateValue) => newValue)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You pass a function argument to `setState`. Internally, React will invoke this function with the previous state as an argument. Whatever is returned from this function is set as the new state.
{% endhint %}

When your new state depends on the previous state value â€” e.g., a computation â€” favor the functional state update. Since `setState` is async, React guarantees that the previous state value is accurate.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <p>Count value is: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      <button 
        onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>
        Plus (+)
      </button>
      <button 
        onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>
       Minus (-)
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

In the example above, the button grows every time itâ€™s clicked. Since the new state value depends on the old, the functional update form of `setState` is preferred.

### Lazily initializing state <a href="#lazilyinitializingstate" id="lazilyinitializingstate"></a>

The `initialState` argument to `useState` is only used during your initial render.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/re-render queue (1).gif>)

```
// this is OK 
const [state, setState] = useState(10) 

// subsequent prop updates are ignored 
const App = ({myProp}) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(myProp)
}
// only the initial myProp value on initial render is passed as initialState. subsequent updates are ignored.
```

However, if the initial state is a result of an expensive computation, you could also pass a function, which will be invoked only on initial render:

```
const [state, setState] = useState(() => yourExpensiveComputation(props))
```

### Initialize state from function

As opposed to just passing an initial state value, state could also be initialized from a function, as shown below:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  const [token] = useState(() => {
    const token = window.localStorage.getItem("sensetive-data");
    return token || "please don't put sensetive data here ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢"
  })

  return <div>Token is {token}</div>
}
```

### **use with objects**

As opposed to strings and numbers, you could also use an object as the initial value passed to `useState`.

Note that you have to pass the entire object to the `useState` updater function because the object is replaced, not merged.This is very different from how `this.setState` worked in classes!

```
function Component() {
  const [state, setState] = useState({ name: "Mayssa" });
  const updateState = () => setState({ occupation: "Teacher" });
  return (
    <>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(state)}</pre>
      <button onClick={updateState}>update state</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

So in order to add an property to the object, weâ€™re using the ES6 spread operator `...` to copy the existing properties into the new object,&#x20;

```
const updateState = () =>  setState((prevState) => ({ ...prevState, { occupation: "Teacher" }));
```

Pass a function to `setState` and return a merged object by using the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread\_syntax) ([`Object.assign` also works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global\_Objects/Object/assign)).

### **use with arrays**

Remember: state can hold any kind of value! Hereâ€™s an example of useState holding an array.

Typing into the box and hitting Enter will add an item to the list.

```
function ListOfThings() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [itemName, setItemName] = useState("");

  const addItem = event => {
    event.preventDefault();
    setItems([
      ...items,
      {
        id: items.length,
        name: itemName
      }
    ]);
    setItemName("");
  };

  return (
    <>
      <form onSubmit={addItem}>
        <label>
          <input
            name="item"
            type="text"
            value={itemName}
            onChange={e => setItemName(e.target.value)}
          />
        </label>
      </form>
      <ul>
        {items.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

Notice weâ€™re calling useState with an initial value of an empty array `[]`,&#x20;

Such as objects, in order to add an item to the array, weâ€™re using the ES6 spread operator `...` to copy the existing items into the new array, and inserting the new item at the end.

### **M**ultiple calls to useState

If you want to store multiple values in a function component, youâ€™ve got a couple options:

* call `useState` more than once
* shove everything into an object

Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with calling `useState` multiple times, and in most cases, thatâ€™s how I store multiple values. Once you get over 4 or 5 useState calls it gets a bit unwieldy, but if youâ€™re fine with it, React is too.

Multiple state variables may be used and updated from within a functional component as shown below:

```jsx
const Component =() => {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(19)
  const [siblingsNum, setSiblingsNum] = 
    useState(10)

  const handleAge = () => setAge(age + 1)
  const handleSiblingsNum = () => 
      setSiblingsNum(siblingsNum + 1)
 

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Today I am {age} Years of Age</p>
      <p>I have {siblingsNum Multiple state variables may be used and updated from within a functional component as shown below:} siblings</p>

      <div>
        <button onClick={handleAge}>
          Get older! 
        </button>
        <button onClick={handleSiblingsNum}>
            More siblings! 
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Bailing out of a state update <a href="#bailingoutofastateupdate" id="bailingoutofastateupdate"></a>

If you try to update state with the same value as the current state, React wonâ€™t render the component children or fire effects, e.g., `useEffect` callbacks. React compares previous and current state via the [`Object.is` comparison algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global\_Objects/Object/is#Description); if they are equal, it ignores the re-render.

Itâ€™s important to note that in some cases, React may still render the specific component whose state was updated. Thatâ€™s OK because React will _not_ go deeper into the tree, i.e., render the componentâ€™s children.

If expensive calculations are done within the body of your functional component, i.e., before the return statement, consider optimizing these with `useMemo`.
