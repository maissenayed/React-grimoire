# When to use React.memo

Since the release of the react hooks, there has been a lot of discussion about the use of memo() and useMemo(), but memoization is rarely required. A good composition of your components and state is frequently the best solution, which is why these guidelines are important. Consider learning more about keys, refs, and advanced react development depending on how you need to optimize your rendering.

#### On memoization / performance :

There's been a lot of conversation around the use of memo() and useMemo() since the react hooks have been released but memoization is rarely necessary. A good composition of your components and state is often the right solution and this is in part why these guidelines are important. Depending on how you need to optimize your rendering, maybe consider learning more about [keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) , [refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper) and [advanced react development](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html) .

Also maybe in the future everything will be memorized by react it self &#x20;
