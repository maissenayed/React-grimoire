AS a React developer, you may have asked the following question at least once.

· How to develop **reusable** components that can be applied to various cases ?

· How to create a component that provides an easy-to-use and **simple API ?**

· What do you need to develop **extensible** components for both UI and functionality ?

These questions have been recurring since the past, and the React community has come up with some advanced patterns as answers to them.
