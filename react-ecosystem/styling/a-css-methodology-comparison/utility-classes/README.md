# Utility Classes

Utility-first CSS is a methodology that came about in an effort to solve all the cons mentioned above with writing traditional CSS. Utility-first CSS involves using many small helper classes to make up a component’s styles, instead of writing class names based on semantic meaning. One thing to keep in mind is that utility-first CSS doesn’t need any library, it is simply a methodology that can be applied to CSS, similar to how BEM works.

I will be focusing on the library [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), since it is probably the most popular approach developers are flocking to for implementing utility-first css.
