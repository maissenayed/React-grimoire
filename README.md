# ‚Åâ Introduction

My father always told me That knowledge mostly need to be free . I believe that too .\
Witnessing the struggle most people find while working with react . finding simple tutorial here and there that give beginner Knowledge , but rarely going deep to concept and advanced features.

And most Master classes are very expensive to reach specially in MENA region. \
Therefore I wanted to create this booklet to give the step up for people for free.&#x20;

### Disclaimer&#x20;

I recommend to have a good basic knowledge with JavaScript, DOM manipulation concepts .

I recommend to dive deep in those concept before tackling React and i assure you not that React will be easier to understand but anything that involve JavaScript Ecosystem will be easier to digest.&#x20;
